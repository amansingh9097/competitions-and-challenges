Urn X has a 4/7 probability of giving a red ball<br>
Urn Y has a 5/9 probability of giving a red ball<br>
Urn Z has a 1/2 probability of giving a red ball<br>

Urn X has a 3/7 probability of giving a black ball<br>
Urn Y has a 4/9 probability of giving a black ball<br>
Urn Z has a 1/2 probability of giving a black ball<br>

P(2 red, 1 black)<br>
= P(Red Red Black) + P(Red Black Red) + P(Black Red Red)<br>
= (4/7)(5/9)(1/2) + (4/7)(4/9)(1/2) + (3/7)(5/9)(1/2)<br>
= 20/126 + 16/126 + 15/126<br>
= 51/126<br>
= 17/42
