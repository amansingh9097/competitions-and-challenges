- missed_payments: Count of missed or delayed payments.
- credit_history_length: Number of years since first credit account.
- age: Customer age in years.
- debt_to_income: Total debt divided by monthly income.


General Risk Rules:
- Utilization above 70% significantly increases risk.
- More than 1 missed payment in last 12 months increases risk.
- A long clean credit history decreases risk.
- High income-to-debt ratio reduces risk.
- Younger customers with short histories may show more volatility.


Reasoning Patterns:
- Pattern A: High income + long history → low risk.
- Pattern B: High utilization + missed payments → high risk.
- Pattern C: Young age + short credit history → medium/high risk.
- Pattern D: Low utilization + no missed payments → low risk.
